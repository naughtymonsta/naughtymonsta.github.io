      <description>I don&#39;t fear death, but rather the unlived life. I don&#39;t have to live forever. I just have to live. - Natalie Babbitt
 Don&#39;t you have a feeling that the world is going to end soon? We&#39;re hunting and poaching animals ruthlessly to a point that we&#39;re driving many different species into extinction; societies are being divided into different groups that can&#39;t even tolerate each other; everybody&#39;s so busy working and making money, we barely pay enough attention to each other anymore; and on top of that, we like to use advanced technologies to help us catch huge amount of fish from the ocean without thinking about the long-term consequences, but only focusing on profits.</description>
