      <description>Scientists have spent huge amount of time &amp;amp; effort on discovering different animal species, they&#39;ve travelled the world to hunt down the animals that have never been seen &amp;amp; heard before, and tell us about these new discoveries.
But there are some creatures - &amp;ldquo;monstas&amp;rdquo; - they&#39;ve been hiding from us all the time in their universe, which is a universe compleletely separated from the 3-dimentional universe that we humans live in.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t fear death, but rather the unlived life. I don&#39;t have to live forever. I just have to live. - Natalie Babbitt
 Don&#39;t you have a feeling that the world is going to end soon? We&#39;re hunting and poaching animals ruthlessly to a point that we&#39;re driving many different species into extinction; societies are being divided into different groups that can&#39;t even tolerate each other; everybody&#39;s so busy working and making money, we barely pay enough attention to each other anymore; and on top of that, we like to use advanced technologies to help us catch huge amount of fish from the ocean without thinking about the long-term consequences, but only focusing on profits.</description>

      <description>He moved over to the window Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly.
Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig iron.</description>

      <description>There was no way of knowing whose version would finally be adopted Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. Something seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the same job as himself. There was no way of knowing whose version would finally be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own

      <description>He moved over to the window Lorem markdownum comes; pro est modo famulus, quo quod neu manibus aether his nomine, Aurora, voce. Ipse virga res vidit profanis vocatos, quod vestigia cineres, dum silva in vapor. Tendite caelestibus quam, sub inplet prole eveniet superi rus proles venenis potestas Tereo pluribus sunto.
Perque cessisse, hoc tum auras sinuosa. Pressant nec vinci primoque quoque funibus est: et tempore vetitorum? Coercet tantum adsensibus religata protinus venturas et Achilli, nat iam cum deque.</description>
